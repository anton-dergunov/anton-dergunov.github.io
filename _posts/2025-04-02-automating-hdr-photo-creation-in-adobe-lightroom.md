TODO Fix script to process ARW and arw (lower case) files.

Have you ever taken a photo of a breathtaking sunset, only to find the sky blown out or the foreground lost in shadows? This is a common limitation of digital photography ‚Äî but HDR (High Dynamic Range) photography offers a powerful solution.

In this blog post, we‚Äôll explore:
- What HDR photography is and how it works
- When HDR is helpful ‚Äî and when it‚Äôs not
- The challenges of processing HDR images for large photo collections
- And finally, a method to automate HDR merging in Adobe Lightroom to simplify your workflow

If you‚Äôd prefer to skip straight to the automation solution, feel free to jump to the section: ‚ÄúThe Automated Process for Merging HDR Photos in Adobe Lightroom‚Äù.

TODO Insert a link to this section.

But first, let‚Äôs understand the fundamentals.

## What is HDR?

HDR stands for High Dynamic Range, a photographic technique designed to overcome the limitations of digital sensors. It allows you to capture a wider range of brightness levels than a single exposure can.

### Why is this necessary?

A typical camera sensor can‚Äôt handle extreme contrasts ‚Äî like the bright sun and dark shadows in the same shot. As a result:
- Highlights may get blown out (completely white)
- Shadows may lose all detail (completely black)

In contrast, the human eye is dynamic ‚Äî it constantly adjusts to different light levels, letting us see both shadows and highlights with clarity. HDR photography aims to mimic this ability.

### A Glimpse into History

The quest to overcome the limitations of photographic technology isn‚Äôt new. In the mid-19th century, Gustave Le Gray, a visionary French photographer, faced the challenge of capturing seascapes where both the sky and sea were correctly exposed ‚Äî a feat difficult due to the varying light intensities.

To address this, Le Gray ingeniously combined two negatives: one exposed for the sky and another for the sea. He then merged them to create a single, harmonious image. One of his most celebrated works, Brig upon the Water (1856), exemplifies this technique.

%}

Fast forward to the 20th century, Ansel Adams, renowned for his breathtaking landscapes, employed meticulous darkroom techniques to enhance the tonal range of his photographs. His iconic image, The Tetons and the Snake River (1942), showcases his mastery in balancing light and shadow to reflect the scene‚Äôs grandeur.

TODO Rewrite to use the original text. Reference the article where I saw these two images.

### How does HDR work?

There are different techniques available for modern HDR photography, but typically it is achieved through a process called **exposure bracketing**, which involves:
- **Taking multiple photos** of the same scene at different exposure levels (underexposed, correctly exposed, and overexposed)
- **Merging these images** into one, so that details from both shadows and highlights are preserved

{% include figure.html
   src="/images/posts/exposure_bracketing.jpg"
   alt="Exposure bracketing"
   caption="Exposure bracketing"
%}

> ‚úÖ **Tip**: Modern smartphones, like iPhones, apply HDR automatically in high-contrast scenes. This happens seamlessly ‚Äî multiple exposures are taken and merged "behind the scenes" into a single photo.

### How to capture HDR photos with cameras

Most mirrorless and DSLR cameras support two HDR modes:

1.	**Auto HDR Mode**
  - The camera takes several exposures and merges them automatically
  - Typically outputs JPEG (not RAW)
  - Great for quick results, but offers limited control
2.	**Exposure Bracketing Mode**
  - The camera captures a set of exposures (e.g. -2, 0, +2 EV)
  - You retain all files (often in RAW format)
  - You later merge them using dedicated HDR software for more precise control

> TODO Merge this text:
> This merging process can be handled:
> - In-camera (some models offer an Auto HDR mode that saves a merged JPEG)
> - Manually using software, which is preferred when working with RAW files for higher image quality and editing flexibility
>
>	1.	Capturing Multiple Exposures: Photographers take several shots of the same scene at varying exposure levels (underexposed, correctly exposed, and overexposed) to ensure details are captured across all light intensities.
>	2.	Merging Exposures: Specialized software combines these images into a single HDR image, encompassing the full dynamic range of the scene.
>	3.	Tone Mapping: Since most display devices can‚Äôt showcase the extensive dynamic range of HDR images, tone mapping compresses this range to fit within the display‚Äôs capabilities, ensuring the final image appears natural and detailed.

> üîß **How to enable this on Sony cameras (as an example)**:
>
> To **bracket exposures**, access the camera menu and look for `Drive Mode > Bracket: Cont. or Bracket Settings`. You can then choose how many frames to capture and the EV step (e.g. ¬±1, ¬±2 stops).
>
> For **Auto HDR**, go to `Menu > Camera Settings > Auto HDR` and set it to ON. Keep in mind this only saves JPEGs and disables RAW capture.


## When to Use HDR Photos

HDR isn‚Äôt just about dramatic, ‚Äúgritty‚Äù images ‚Äî in fact, some of the best HDR photos look completely natural. The power of HDR lies in its ability to expand the tonal range of a photo, helping you capture both shadow detail and highlights that would otherwise be lost.

The key is using HDR where it actually makes a difference. Here are the types of scenes where HDR truly shines:

‚úÖ Ideal Situations for HDR
- **Landscape photography**.
  Wide-open scenes with bright skies and darker foregrounds often exceed the dynamic range of your camera. HDR helps retain cloud texture and shadow detail, all in one image.
- **Cityscapes and architecture**.
  Buildings often have both reflective surfaces and deep shadows. HDR balances these extremes, preserving texture without overexposing the sky.
- **Interior photography**.
  Taking a photo inside with bright windows? HDR allows you to reveal interior details while still showing the scene outside the window.
- **Backlit or spotlighted subjects**.
  When a subject is strongly backlit or illuminated by a spotlight (natural or artificial), HDR can recover facial features or detail without washing out the highlights.
- **Progressive lighting**.
  For example, vaulted ceilings or underground passages lit from below, where light gradually fades or intensifies. HDR captures the full range of tones.
- **Small bright areas in dark surroundings**.
  Like a single sunbeam breaking through trees, or a candlelit room with a bright window. These ‚Äúbright spots‚Äù are where HDR helps avoid blown-out highlights.

Examples:

Below is an HDR photo taken at Warner Bros. Studio‚Äôs Harry Potter Tour. It captures the vibrant Weasleys‚Äô Wizard Wheezes shop, but at the same time captures the details of the dim atmosphere of Diagon Alley.

   caption="*Diagon Alley (HDR example)* ‚Äì Warner Bros Tour London. Photo by the author."
%}

Another example is this photo of a church interior taken with an iPhone. The phone automatically applied HDR because of the high contrast between the bright windows and the dim interior.

   alt="Henton Chapel - HDR"
   caption="*Henton Chapel (iPhone HDR)* ‚Äì Chiltern Open Air Museum. Photo by the author."
%}

‚ùå When Not to Use HDR

HDR isn‚Äôt always the right choice. Here are scenarios where it may work poorly:
- **Scenes with movement**.
  HDR combines multiple exposures. If anything moves between shots ‚Äî people, cars, leaves ‚Äî you may get ghosting (a double-exposure-like effect). While Lightroom offers a Deghosting option, it only works well for small movements. Larger movements will still ruin the merge.
- **Low-contrast scenes**.
  If your scene is evenly lit, HDR adds little benefit and can actually make your photo look flat or over-processed.
- **Portraits**.
  HDR can exaggerate skin texture and create an unnatural look. While some artistic portraits may use it creatively, it‚Äôs best avoided for natural skin tones.

Common Issues with HDR

Even when used in the right scenarios, HDR processing introduces its own challenges. These usually appear during tone mapping, which is the step where software compresses the wide dynamic range into something viewable on screens.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Typical HDR Artifacts**:
- **Halos**:
  Bright or dark fringes around edges, caused by too much local contrast.
- **Ghosting**:
  Semi-transparent overlaps from moving objects during bracketing.
- **Noise**:
  HDR can amplify noise in dark areas, especially from smaller sensors or high ISOs.
- **Artificial look**:
  Overdone tone mapping can lead to unnatural colors, exaggerated textures, and surreal microcontrast.

Many HDR tools ‚Äî like Lightroom and Photomatix ‚Äî offer controls to manage these issues, including ghost removal, contrast smoothing, and highlight/shadow compression.

Examples:

The photo below, shot with a point-and-shoot camera and processed as HDR, recovered detailed of the face of the brightly lit Goblin. But it also looks flat, with little separation between foreground and background.

{% include figure.html
   src="/images/posts/hdr_example_goblin_teller_thumb.jpg"
   url="/images/posts/hdr_example_goblin_teller_full.jpg"
   alt="Goblin Teller - HDR"
   caption="*Goblin Teller (HDR example)* ‚Äì Warner Bros Tour London. Photo by the author."
%}

Here‚Äôs another photo from the same camera. There is noise in darker areas that became more visible after the HDR merge.

{% include figure.html
   src="/images/posts/hdr_example_monster_book_thumb_edit.jpg"
   url="/images/posts/hdr_example_monster_book_full.jpg"
   alt="The Monster Book of Monsters - HDR"
   caption="*The Monster Book of Monsters (HDR example)* ‚Äì Warner Bros Tour London. Photo by the author."
%}

TODO Visualize on the thumbnail image where the noise is (display circle, then arrow, then enlarged area).

> üì∏ **Tip: When in Doubt, Bracket**
>
> It‚Äôs not always obvious whether HDR will improve your photo. A good practice is to shoot with exposure bracketing when you‚Äôre unsure. This gives you the option to merge later on your computer ‚Äî and compare results ‚Äî without missing the shot.


## Merging HDR Photos in Adobe Lightroom

To create HDR images, you‚Äôll need to merge multiple bracketed exposures into a single photo. Several tools are available for this purpose, including Photomatix, LR/Enfuse, and others. However, Adobe Lightroom provides a built-in and relatively streamlined way to do this ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre already using it as part of your workflow.

### Using Lightroom (Cloud Version)

Personally, I use the cloud-based version of Lightroom (not Lightroom Classic). It comes with 1TB of cloud storage, making your photo library accessible from any device ‚Äî including the desktop app, iPad app, and even the web. All edits and metadata are automatically synchronized, allowing me to start editing on my computer and seamlessly continue on my iPad while traveling.

The actual HDR merging process in Lightroom is fairly manual:

1. **Identify Exposure Bracketed Groups**.
I don‚Äôt use exposure bracketing for every shot ‚Äî only when the scene has high dynamic range and could benefit from HDR. As a result, my photo library is a mix of single exposures and bracketed sequences. To find bracketed groups, I visually scan for similar-looking photos taken seconds apart, and use the Info panel to confirm that their capture times are very close.
	2.	Merge to HDR
Once a group is identified, I select the images and choose Photo Merge ‚Üí HDR (or press Ctrl + H). Lightroom then displays the HDR Merge dialog, where I can preview the result and adjust settings like Deghost Amount (used to correct motion between frames). Clicking Merge adds the task to a background queue, and Lightroom creates a new DNG file for the merged HDR image.

This process works well, but has several limitations:
	‚Ä¢	Manual group detection
Lightroom (cloud version) does not automatically detect exposure brackets. There‚Äôs no way to view exposure compensation values, so I must rely on visual cues and timestamps.
	‚Ä¢	No batch merging
Each group must be manually selected and merged. This becomes tedious when dealing with large sets of bracketed images, especially after a trip.
	‚Ä¢	Bracket count is not detected
Lightroom doesn‚Äôt indicate how many exposures are in each bracketed group (e.g., 3, 5, or 7), so you need to remember or check manually.

‚∏ª

Automating HDR Merge in Lightroom Classic

If you‚Äôre using Lightroom Classic, there are more advanced options for automating the process.

One useful feature is Auto-Stack by Capture Time, which groups photos shot within a specified time interval. Since exposure-bracketed images are taken in rapid succession, this can help group them correctly.

You can access this via:
Photo ‚Üí Stacking ‚Üí Auto-Stack by Capture Time‚Ä¶

This opens a dialog where you can specify the time gap (e.g., 2 seconds) to define stack boundaries. In theory, this should group all bracketed sequences automatically. In practice, however, I‚Äôve found this method can be unreliable ‚Äî especially when multiple sequences were shot close together or when the number of exposures per bracket varies.

üí° Tip: Some recommend leaving small gaps between shooting brackets to help Lightroom auto-stack more reliably. However, this isn‚Äôt always practical when you‚Äôre shooting on location, and doesn‚Äôt help if you‚Äôre working with existing photos.

Once the stacks are created, you can select all stacks and apply the HDR Merge command in batch mode. Lightroom Classic will process each stack as a separate HDR job. This allows you to queue up multiple merges and step away from your computer while they complete.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This batch merging feature is not available in the cloud-based Lightroom. If you select multiple bracketed groups and run HDR Merge there, only the last selected group will be merged.

A good walkthrough of this workflow is available in the video:

‚∏ª

Automating HDR Merging with a Custom Lightroom Plugin

To address the limitations in Lightroom‚Äôs manual HDR merging workflow, I developed a small tool: the Lightroom Auto Stacker Plugin. As the name suggests, the plugin automates the first crucial step‚Äîdetecting groups of exposure-bracketed photos and stacking them automatically.

Unlike Lightroom‚Äôs built-in Auto-Stack by Capture Time feature, which relies on time gaps between shots, my plugin analyzes EXIF metadata embedded in each image file to group photos that were taken as part of an exposure bracket sequence. This method is significantly more reliable and works even when timing between shots is inconsistent.

‚∏ª

A Quick Introduction to EXIF Metadata

EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) data is metadata stored within image files that describes how and when a photo was taken. It includes standard tags such as exposure time, aperture, ISO, and timestamp, along with many camera-specific details.

To analyze EXIF metadata, I use ExifTool, a powerful command-line utility that can extract metadata from virtually any image format. It supports a vast number of tags and is maintained by the photography and digital imaging community. ExifTool is especially useful for exploring maker-specific tags‚Äîmetadata fields that camera manufacturers add on top of the standard EXIF specification.

‚∏ª

Analyzing Metadata from a Sony Camera

Let‚Äôs take a look at an example of four RAW files shot with a Sony camera:

Field	DSC02107.ARW	DSC02108.ARW	DSC02109.ARW	DSC02110.ARW
EXIF:DateTimeOriginal	2025:03:15 17:35:41	2025:03:15 17:36:56	2025:03:15 17:36:56	2025:03:15 17:36:56
EXIF:ExposureMode	0	2	2	2
EXIF:ExposureCompensation	0.3	0.3	-0.7	1.3
MakerNotes:ReleaseMode	0	5	5	5
MakerNotes:SequenceImageNumber	1	1	2	3
MakerNotes:SequenceLength	1	3	3	3

	‚Ä¢	DSC02107.ARW was taken as a single exposure.
	‚Ä¢	DSC02108.ARW‚ÄìDSC02110.ARW form a 3-image exposure-bracketed sequence.

This analysis shows how metadata can reveal structured shooting modes, even when timestamps are ambiguous or identical.

‚∏ª

Key Metadata Fields Explained

Here‚Äôs how the plugin uses specific EXIF and MakerNotes fields to detect exposure-bracketed groups:
	‚Ä¢	EXIF:ExposureMode:
	‚Ä¢	0 = Auto Exposure
	‚Ä¢	2 = Manual exposure or bracketed shots depending on the context
This helps differentiate between standard and special shooting modes.
	‚Ä¢	MakerNotes:ReleaseMode (Sony-specific):
	‚Ä¢	0 = Single shot
	‚Ä¢	5 = Continuous bracketing or burst
When the value is 5, it indicates that the shot is part of a bracketed sequence.
	‚Ä¢	MakerNotes:SequenceLength and SequenceImageNumber:
These indicate the total number of images in the sequence and the position of each image within it.
	‚Ä¢	For a single photo: SequenceLength = 1
	‚Ä¢	For a 3-image bracket: SequenceLength = 3, with SequenceImageNumber = 1, 2, 3
	‚Ä¢	EXIF:ExposureCompensation:
In bracketed sequences, the compensation changes per shot. For example, with a base exposure compensation of 0.3 and a ¬±1.0 EV bracket:
	‚Ä¢	First image: 0.3 (base)
	‚Ä¢	Second image: -0.7 (0.3 - 1.0)
	‚Ä¢	Third image: 1.3 (0.3 + 1.0)

These patterns are used by the plugin to reliably identify bracketed groups‚Äîsomething that is not feasible using timestamps alone.

üìå Note: Standard EXIF fields (like EXIF:ExposureMode) are generally consistent across camera brands. However, MakerNotes fields (such as ReleaseMode and SequenceLength) are proprietary and vary between manufacturers. At present, the plugin supports Sony cameras, but I plan to expand it to support additional camera brands. You can find the complete list of Sony-specific tags used by ExifTool here.

‚∏ª

Plugin Architecture

The solution is structured into two key components:
	‚Ä¢	Python Script:
This script analyzes the EXIF metadata of all imported files and identifies exposure-bracketed groups. It outputs a group description file, which lists image sequences that should be stacked together.
	‚Ä¢	Lightroom Plugin:
This plugin reads the group description file and uses the Lightroom SDK to automatically create stacks inside Lightroom. Once stacked, these groups can be batch-merged into HDR photos using Lightroom‚Äôs built-in merge functionality.

This setup provides a more robust, scalable, and user-friendly workflow‚Äîespecially useful when returning from a trip with hundreds of mixed images.

The Automated Process for Merging HDR Photos in Adobe Lightroom

This section outlines the full workflow for using the plugin to automate HDR merging in Adobe Lightroom Classic.

üß© Installation Instructions

Python Script
	1.	Install Python (if not already installed).
	2.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/anton-dergunov/lightroom-hdr-auto-stack.git
cd lightroom-hdr-auto-stack


	3.	Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Lightroom Plugin
	1.	Launch Adobe Lightroom Classic
(Note: The non-Classic version does not support plugins as of now.)
	2.	Open Plug-in Manager:
	‚Ä¢	Navigate to File > Plug-in Manager.
	3.	Add the Plugin:
	‚Ä¢	Click Add and select the auto-stacker.lrplugin folder.
	‚Ä¢	Enable the plugin once added.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è Usage Instructions

1. Detect Bracketed Images

Run the Python script to analyze your photo directory and generate a group description file based on detected exposure brackets.

python group_sony_bracketed_photos.py --input /path/to/photos --output /path/to/groups.txt

You can also specify a different file extension with --extension (default is ARW).

2. Import and Auto-Stack in Lightroom
	‚Ä¢	In Lightroom Classic, navigate to Library > Plug-in Extras > Import and Auto Stack Photos.
	‚Ä¢	Provide the path to the generated groups.txt file.
	‚Ä¢	The plugin will import the images and automatically stack them based on detected brackets.

3. Batch Create HDR Images
	‚Ä¢	Open the folder with the imported stacks.
	‚Ä¢	Collapse all stacks: Photo > Stacking > Collapse All Stacks.
	‚Ä¢	Select all stacks: Edit > Select All.
	‚Ä¢	Begin the merge: Photo > Photo Merge > HDR‚Ä¶.

Lightroom will queue a batch merge for each stack using your last-used HDR merge settings (such as Deghosting). Note that this step may take time depending on the number of stacks.

4. Access and Export HDR Images
	‚Ä¢	If you‚Äôre working in Lightroom Classic, you can continue editing directly. To quickly locate HDR files, filter the Library view by the .dng extension.
	‚Ä¢	If you prefer the cloud-based version of Lightroom, you can export the HDR images. They‚Äôre saved in the same folder as the originals and typically named using the first file‚Äôs name followed by -HDR.dng.

‚∏ª

üì∏ Real-World Workflow

When I return from a photo walk, I use this plugin to automatically detect and merge all HDR image sets. While the process is largely hands-free, it does take a few minutes to run‚Äîespecially for larger shoots. Once HDR images are generated, I import both the original files and the HDR files into Lightroom Cloud storage (called Lightroom for desktop/mobile, which syncs across devices).

This pre-processing step has become a crucial part of my workflow. It allows me to review all HDR and original exposures side-by-side during the culling phase, which I can do either on my desktop or directly on my iPad. HDR isn‚Äôt always the better version‚Äîsometimes I keep the HDR, sometimes I prefer one of the original exposures. Having all options upfront saves time and helps me make creative decisions later, rather than guessing in the field.

If I notice artifacts like ghosting or poor tone mapping, I can always manually re-merge specific brackets using different Lightroom settings. But having most of the work done automatically up front is a huge time saver.

‚∏ª

Final Thoughts

HDR photography can elevate your images‚Äîwhen used thoughtfully. But the merging process can quickly become a bottleneck, especially when dealing with dozens or hundreds of exposures. This plugin is designed to streamline that step, using camera metadata to detect exposure brackets with higher reliability than timestamp-based methods.

By automating the HDR merge workflow, this tool helps me focus more on the creative side of photography, rather than repetitive file management. I hope it can do the same for you.

You can find the source code, instructions, and more details here:

Let me know if you‚Äôd like to include a Call to Action like:
	‚Ä¢	Invite readers to try the plugin and share feedback.
	‚Ä¢	Ask for contributions to support other camera manufacturers.
	‚Ä¢	Mention plans for future updates (e.g., UI improvements, better support for batch control).

High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography allows photographers to capture a broader range of light and detail than standard photography. While Adobe Lightroom provides tools for HDR merging, the process can be labor-intensive, especially when dealing with numerous images. This article explores an approach to automate HDR photo creation, enhancing efficiency and workflow.

In this blog post I would like to do a short intro to HDR photography, when to use and when not to use it and the challenges when you need to merge lots of HDR photos and the motivation for automation.
If you would like to know how the automated process that I propose straight away, you can jump to the last section "The Automated Process for Merging HDR Photos in Adobe Lightroom".


## What is HDR?

HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. In photography, it refers to a technique that combines multiple images taken at different exposures to produce a single photograph with a wider range of brighness (dynamic range). This method ensures that both the darkest and brightest areas of a scene are well-exposed, capturing details that might be lost in a single shot.

HDR photography relies on a method called _exposure bracketing_. This involves taking several photos of the same scene at varying exposure levels ‚Äî typically underexposed, correctly exposed, and overexposed. These images are then merged to create a composite that captures the full dynamic range of the scene.

![Exposure bracketing](/images/posts/exposure_bracketing.jpg)

TODO Add arrows and the final merged image for the image above.

Merging of the photos can be done automatically by the camera, or the camera can save the separate shots and you can later use software to merge them to the single image.

Modern smartphones, like Apple's iPhones, utilize HDR to automatically enhance photos: they automatically detect high-contrast scenes, take several shots in this case and merge them into a single image. All of this happens automatically and behind the scenes.

Specialized cameras, such as mirrorless and point and shoot cameras, frequently also support HDR.

- You can select a special mode (such as [Auto HDR in Sony cameras](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/articles/00012101)), and the camera will take images with different exposures, merge them, and save as JPEG image (RAW format is usually not supported in this case).
- They also support a more flexible appoach: use [exposure bracketing](https://www.mikesmithphotography.com/videos/exposure-bracketing) to take images with different exposures (which can be saved in RAW format), and later merge them with specialized software. This is the most flexible approach, but it requires extra work.

TODO Briefly describe how to enable this in Sony cameras.


## When to Use HDR Photos?

HDR is particularly effective in situations where there‚Äôs a significant difference between the brightest and darkest areas of a scene. Some examples are:

- **Landscape photography**: Capturing details in both bright skies and shadowed foregrounds.
- **Interior photography**: Showcasing room details while preserving window views. Usually 
- **Backlit subjects**: When the main subject is against a strong light source, HDR can balance the exposure to reveal details in both the subject and background.

The photo below is an example of HDR photo that I took in Warner Brothers Studio Harry Potter Tour. It shows a dimly lit street with shady shops, but the Weasleys‚Äô Wizard Wheezes shop is bright and colourful. I used exposure bracketing to take 3 photos with different exposures, and then combined them with Lightroom to get more details in dark areas, but at the same time making sure that the bright shop is not overexposed.

![Diagon Alley from Harry Potter as HDR photo example](/images/posts/hdr-photo-1.jpg)

The interior of a little church in the photo below was shot using iPhone. The smartphone has automatically recognized that this is a high-contrast scene and automatically produced HDR photo. As a result, we can see the view through the windows (even though it is still overexposed, since the day was unusually sunny).

![Henton Chapel from Chiltern Open Air Museum, photo with iPhone in HDR](/images/posts/hdr-photo-iphone.jpg)

When not to use HDR?

- **Scenes with movement**: HDR requires multiple exposures; moving subjects can lead to ghosting or blurring. Lightroom provides Deghosting parameter when merging HDR photos which can help with small movements, but the photos can't be merged effectively when the movement is too big (TODO find better adjective).
- **Low-contrast scenes**: Applying HDR to scenes without significant contrast may result in flat or unnatural images.
- **Portraits**: HDR can exaggerate skin imperfections, making it less suitable for flattering portraits.

Potential problems with overusing HDR:

- **Unnatural Appearance**: Excessive HDR processing can lead to images that look overly processed and unrealistic.
- **Increased Noise**: Combining multiple exposures can amplify noise, especially in darker areas.
- **Halos and Artifacts**: Improper alignment or excessive tone mapping can introduce halos around objects and other visual artifacts.

The photo with Goblin Teller below was shot with a point-and-shoot camera (which has smaller dynamic range than mirrorless cameras) and later processed as HDR image. This allowed the recover the details of the brightly lit face of Goblin, but at the same time the photo lacks depth, the background is not as clearly separated, so the image looks quite flat.

![Goblin Teller as HDR photo example](/images/posts/hdr-photo-3.jpg)

The photo below of Harry Potter and The Monster Book of Monsters was shot with the same camera and also merged as HDR image. You can notice quite a lot of noise in darker areas which was amplified after HDR merge.

![Harry Potter and The Monster Book of Monsters as HDR photo example](/images/posts/hdr-photo-5.jpg)

TODO: Make the photos smaller in size, resize them.

In many cases it is possible to tell in advance which photo will look better in HDR or as a regular photo, but in some cases it is not quite obvious. The best approach could be to take photos with exposure bracketing when in doubt and later review photos on computer and decide which version to keep.


## Merging HDR Photos with Adobe Lightroom

Several specialized software can be used for merging these photos on your computer, such as [Photomatrix](https://www.hdrsoft.com/), [LR/Enfuse](https://www.photographers-toolbox.com/products/lrenfuse.php) and many others. Adobe Lightroom also provides a capability to merge HDR photos.

Personally I use Lightroom (non-Classic version). The subscription comes with 1TB online storage for photos. This makes the photos accessible from all Lightroom apps (with the desktop app, the the iPad app or even in the web), and all the changes and adjustments are synchronized and stored globally in the cloud. This allows me to process photos on my computer when I am at home, or on my iPad when I am on the go.

The process for merging HDR photos in Adobe Lightroom is mostly manual:

1. **Detect groups of photos**. At first, we need to identify the group of photos which were shot with exposure bracketing. I don't use this mode for all photos, but only in situations when I think that the scene is high contrast and the photo could benefit from HDR merging. As a result, the photos are usually a mix of single exposure and exposure bracketed photos. I am trying to visually identify such groups of photos and use "Info" window to double check the capture time (which should be very close in this group).
2. **HDR Merge each group**. Once the group is visually identified, I select all photos in the group and call context menu "Photo Merge -> HDR Merge..." (or use shortcut `Control + H`). This shows "HDR Merge" dialog which provides an overview of the final image and several configuration parameters (such as "Deghost Amount" which TBD describe). Pressing "Merge" button creates a job to merge HDR photo.

![HDR Merge in Lightroom](/images/posts/lightroom_hdr_merge.jpg)

As can be seen, the process is very manual:
- Detecting exposure bracketed photos is not automated in Lightroom, so I need to manually find and select them, which takes time, because I need to double check that the photos were really shot as a group. Unfortunately, Lightroom does not show exposure compensation values, so I have to rely on capture date for this.
- Merging HDR photos takes quite a lot of time and I need to initiate this for every group of photos.

As you can see, this process does not scale very well, especially in the following situations:
- Merging a large number of images, especially when you get back from a long trip.
- Working with mixed photo collections where not all files are exposure bracketed (which is usually the case, since I don't use exposure bracketing when not needed).
- Managing different burst numbers in your shooting sequence. TBD describe that it could be 3, 5, etc image.

Adobe Lightroom _Classic_ version provides several features that can automate the process.

First of all, it provides an "Auto-Stack by Capture Time" feature (this feature is not yet available in the non-Classic version). This involves selecting the photos and then using menu Photo -> Stacking -> Auto-Stack by Capture Time.

![Auto-Stack by Capture Time in Lightroom](/images/posts/lightroom_auto_stack.png)

In the dialog that is shown you need to input the time threshold between the photos to auto stack. This method is useful, because exposure bracketed photos are shot in quick succession. However, I found that this method of setting the precise threshold is not very reliable for the photos that I had: no matter how much I tweak this parameter, I never get the all the exposure bracketed photos to be grouped correctly. One approach which is usually recommended is to make sure you have a small delay when shooting different photos, so that auto stacking later in software could be more reliable. However, this advice does not help if you already have the photos to process. It also complicates shooting photos, since this is one extra thing to think about.

Once the photos are auto-stacked, you can select all stacks and invoke "HDR Merge" command (from the menu or using the same `Control + H` key combination). This will start a job to merge each stack and produce HDR photos in batch mode. At this moment you can sit back, relax and return to computer when the merging is finished. However, note that the same trick would not work in non-Classic Lightroom version: selecting stacks and calling "HDR Merge" would only merge the last selected stack.

These tricks to automate HDR merge in Lightroom Classic version are described in this [YouTube video "Automate HDR Image Merging in Adobe Lightroom \| Automate Your Exposure Bracketing Photo Workflow"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFbQ-djJ_sY) in detail.


## Creating a New Lightroom Plugin to Automate Merging HDR Photos

To overcome these problems mentioned above and make the process of HDR merging more automated and more reliable, I have created a small plugin: [Lightroom Auto Stacker Plugin](https://github.com/anton-dergunov/lightroom-exposure-bracket-auto-stacker). As indicated in the name, the plugin is specifically aimed at automating the 1st step: detecting groups of exposure bracketing photos and auto-stacking them.

Instead of using time stamps, such as "Auto-Stack by Capture Time" dialog in Lightroom, the tool is relying on EXIF metadata that the camera stores with each image.

TODO Put a little background about what EXIF data is. Also mention [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) and provide some overview of this tool. Say that it is a really robust tool, supports many file formats.

Wearing my data scientist hat, let's do some data analysis. Below are some EXIF fields for some files that I took with a Sony camera.

| SourceFile                     | DSC02107.ARW         | DSC02108.ARW         | DSC02109.ARW         | DSC02110.ARW         |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| EXIF:DateTimeOriginal          | 2025:03:15 17:35:41  | 2025:03:15 17:36:56  | 2025:03:15 17:36:56  | 2025:03:15 17:36:56  |
| EXIF:ExposureMode              | 0                    | 2                    | 2                    | 2                    |
| EXIF:ExposureCompensation      | 0.3                  | 0.3                  | -0.7                 | 1.3                  |
| MakerNotes:ReleaseMode         | 0                    | 5                    | 5                    | 5                    |
| MakerNotes:SequenceImageNumber | 1                    | 1                    | 2                    | 3                    |
| MakerNotes:SequenceLength      | 1                    | 3                    | 3                    | 3                    |

The photo `DSC02107.ARW` was taken as a single exposure photo. And then I took a photo with exposure bracketing (using the mode of 3 exposures and exposure compensation as 1.0).

TODO Is it safe to say that "EXIF:" fields are common for all camera makers, but "MakerNotes:" are speciic to a camera maker.
Please note that the current plugin supports Sony cameras only. You can see the whole list of EXIF tags for sony here: [Sony Tags](https://exiftool.org/TagNames/Sony.html). I plan to generalize this tool for other camera makers.

Let's take a look at these parameters:

- TODO Explain what the fields EXIF:ExposureMode and MakerNotes:ReleaseMode correspond to. You can notice that for the first photo the values for both are 0 (TODO what does it mean?) But for the next 3 photos the values are 2 and 5 correspondingly (TODO explain what these values correspond to). The plugin that I have implemented uses these fields to detect exposure bracketed photos that should be merged.
- The next useful parameter is MakerNotes:SequenceLength. TODO: What does it mean? For single exposure photos the the sequence length is just 1, but for exposure bracketed images this is the number of images in sequence (in our case 3 photos). The tag MakerNotes:SequenceImageNumber index of the image in sequence.
- EXIF:ExposureCompensation: the exposure bracketed images will show different exposure compensation. In this case my default exp comp in camera was 0.3. I used exp bracket with 3 shoots, comp 1.0. So the first shot has the default 0.3, second: 0.3-1.0=-0.7, the third: 0.3+1.0=1.3.

The design of the plugin was hugely influenced by what Lightroom SDK supports, since the API is quite limited. This has lead to design decisions for this plugin.

The solution is divided into two components:

Python Script:
Detects exposure-bracketed image groups using EXIF metadata. It then produces a descriptive file that outlines the detected groups. This method is more reliable than relying solely on capture timing.

Lightroom Plugin:
Reads the group description file and imports the grouped images into Lightroom, automatically stacking them in preparation for HDR processing. Once the stacks are created, you can use Lightroom's built-in HDR merge functionality to batch process the stacks.


## The Automated Process for Merging HDR Photos in Adobe Lightroom

![Automated HDR Merge Process](/images/posts/automated-hdr-merge.gif)

The installation instructions for the plugin are the following:

Python Script

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed).
2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anton-dergunov/lightroom-hdr-auto-stack.git
   cd lightroom-hdr-auto-stack
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Lightroom Plugin

1. **Launch Adobe Lightroom Classic**  
   (Note: The non-Classic version does not support plugins as of now.)
2. **Open Plug-in Manager:**
   - Navigate to **File > Plug-in Manager**.
3. **Add the Plugin:**
   - Click **Add** and select the `auto-stacker.lrplugin` folder.
   - Enable the plugin once added.

The instructions for using the plugin are the following:

1. **Detect Bracketed Images and Generate Groups File:**
   Run the Python script to analyze your photos and create a group description file.
   ```sh
   python group_sony_bracketed_photos.py --input /path/to/photos --output /path/to/groups.txt
   ```
   You may specify a different photo file extension with `--extension` (default is `ARW`).

2. **Import and Auto-Stack in Lightroom:**
   - In Lightroom Classic, go to **Library > Plugin Extras > Import and Auto Stack Photos**.
   - Provide the path to the generated groups file.
   - Wait for the images to be imported and automatically stacked.

3. **Batch Create HDR Images:**
   - Navigate to the folder containing the imported stacks.
   - Collapse all stacks via **Photo > Stacking > Collapse All Stacks**.
   - Select all stacks (**Edit > Select All**) and execute **Photo > Photo Merge > HDR...**.
   - Lightroom will initiate a batch job to merge each stack with previously used settings (e.g., Deghost Amount). Please note that this process can be time-consuming when handling a large number of images.
   - This batch processing ensures that all HDR images are created upfront, allowing for a streamlined photo culling process where HDR and original exposures are available for direct comparison.

4. **Access the Final HDR Images:**
   - If you are using Lightroom Classic, you can continue working with the HDR images directly within the library. To quickly find the HDR images, you can filter the Library View by the `.dng` extension.
   - If you primarily use the the non-Classic version of Lightroom, you can export the created HDR images. The generated HDR images are saved in the same folder as the original files, typically named using the first image‚Äôs filename followed by `-HDR.dng`, so you can copy them directly as well.


When I come home from a walk shooting photos, I use this plugin to automatically merge all HDR photos. This process is automated, but it takes some time to run. When this is ready, I import both the original photos and the generated HDR photos to Adobe Cloud storage (TBD is this the correct name)? This is the useful pre-processing, that allows me to later process and do photo selection all in one go (and decide if I should keep the HDR or any original photos that they were created from). I can do this either on my computer or on iPad. After this pre-processing step, Using this process allows me to see what HDR images look like. I don't always prefer HDR photo. This all depens on case by case basis, and sometimes hard to say in advance. So this saves me time. If I don't like how some photos were merged (for example, there is some ghosting), I can manually recreate the HDR photos in Lightroom with different settings.

**High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography is a collection of photographic techniques that aim to capture and then display a wider range of luminosity levels than can be achieved using standard photographic techniques**. As you know, "HDR" is an abbreviation for "High Dynamic Range". To understand this fully, let's break down what "range," "dynamic," and "high" mean in this context. The **"range"** refers to the spectrum between the lightest and darkest parts of a scene. Your eyes are **"dynamic"** because they can adjust to perceive details across these extremes of light and dark. However, a **conventional single photographic exposure** has a limited ability to capture this entire spectrum when there is a significant difference between the brightest highlights and the deepest shadows. **HDR photography seeks to create images with a "high" dynamic range**, more closely resembling the capabilities of human vision and even extending beyond it to create previously impossible images.

**Limitations of Standard Digital Sensors:**

A key reason for using HDR techniques is the **inherent limitation of digital camera sensors** in capturing the full dynamic range that our eyes can perceive. Unlike our eyes, a camera sensor in a single exposure struggles to record detail in both very bright and very dark areas simultaneously. When the dynamic range of a scene exceeds the sensor's capacity, some areas will inevitably be **"clipped"** ‚Äì either highlights will be overexposed, losing all detail and appearing pure white, or shadows will be underexposed, becoming pure black with no discernible information. Current digital camera sensors cannot even reach a dynamic range of 1000:1, whereas panchromatic film could capture up to 10,000:1. This limitation means that in many real-world scenarios, a single photograph will fail to capture the scene as we experience it.

**A Look at the History:**

While HDR has gained significant traction with the advent of digital photography, the **awareness of the limitations of exposure range is not new**. Even in the early days of photography, practitioners sought ways to overcome these limitations. For instance, [Gustave Le Gray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Le_Gray)'s 19th-century seascapes, which combined separately exposed negatives for the sky and the sea, can be considered early examples of HDR thinking, and his prints have recently fetched record prices at auction. As photography progressed, [Ansel Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansel_Adams) is renowned for his prints' wide tonal range, achieved through meticulous exposure and development using his **zone system**, as well as extensive **dodging and burning** in the darkroom (TBD Please add some links about this). He even used a custom-modified enlarger to extend the dynamic range of his images. Therefore, the concept of extending dynamic range has been a long-standing pursuit in photography. Digital photography now allows for simpler methods to achieve HDR results that were previously impossible.

**The Modern HDR Process:**

The creation of an HDR image typically involves two main phases: **shooting multiple exposures** and **processing these exposures** using specialised software.

*   **Shooting for HDR:**
    *   This often involves **capturing a sequence of images of the same scene with varying exposure levels**, a technique known as **bracketing**. These different exposures ensure that detail is captured in the brightest, midtone, and darkest areas of the scene. Your camera may have an **auto-bracketing function** that automatically takes a series of shots at different exposures. You can also bracket **manually** by adjusting the shutter speed (or sometimes aperture or ISO) between each shot. Using **continuous shooting mode** can help capture these bracketed exposures quickly.
    *   To ensure proper alignment of the multiple exposures, especially for later merging, using a **tripod** is highly recommended. This prevents unwanted shifts between frames. However, even with a tripod, movement within the scene (**camera motion** or subject movement) can occur and needs to be addressed during processing.
    *   To capture the **entire dynamic range** of a scene, you need to ensure that your bracketed exposures range from one where the highlights are correctly exposed (not blown out) to one where the shadows contain detail (not pure black). The number of exposures required depends on the dynamic range of the scene; sometimes two exposures are sufficient, while other high-contrast situations may require more. One technique is to continue shooting until the histogram of the darkest exposure shows detail in what appear to be shadow areas, even if the lighter parts of the image look completely washed out.

*   **HDR Processing (Tone Mapping):**
    *   Once you have your bracketed exposures or multiple versions of a RAW file, they need to be combined using **HDR software**. Popular software options mentioned in the sources include **Adobe Camera RAW, Photoshop, Nik HDR Efex Pro, Photomatix**, as well as **FDRTools, PFSTools, and EasyHDR**. These programs merge the multiple exposures into a single HDR image, which contains a much greater range of luminance values than a standard image format.
    *   Since standard display devices like computer monitors and printed photos have a limited dynamic range (**Low Dynamic Range - LDR**), the high dynamic range of the merged image needs to be compressed into a viewable format through a process called **tone mapping**. **Tonemapping operators (TMOs)** are the algorithms within HDR software that perform this compression. A simple linear compression of the HDR image would result in an image that is too dark with a lack of detail in the shadows. Therefore, tone mapping must consider how we perceive light.
    *   **Common artefacts** can arise during tone mapping. **Halos** are bright or dark fringes that can appear around high-contrast edges, often caused by excessive local contrast adjustments. **Ghosting** occurs when there was movement in the scene between the bracketed exposures, resulting in semi-transparent overlaps of moving objects. **Noise** and exaggerated textures can also become more apparent, especially when trying to maximise fine detail. An **artificial appearance**, with incorrect tones, colours, and exaggerated microcontrast, can result from excessive or incorrect tonemapping. Many HDR software programs offer tools to mitigate these issues, such as ghost reduction and smoothing options.
    *   Often, the initial tone-mapped image will benefit from **further post-processing** in image editing software like Lightroom or Photoshop. This can involve adjusting levels and curves, refining contrast, sharpening, colour correction, and selectively editing specific areas to achieve the desired final look.

**HDR: Beyond the "Gritty" Look:**

It is a common misconception that all HDR images have an unnatural, overly processed, or "gritty" appearance. However, **HDR is a versatile tool that can be used to create very subtle and natural-looking images**. The final aesthetic is largely determined by the photographer's artistic vision and the specific tone mapping settings applied. Carefully applied HDR can enhance the tonal range and detail in a photograph without being overtly noticeable. In fact, some of the most impactful HDR images are those where the viewer may not even realise HDR techniques were used. The key is to exercise good artistic judgment and avoid pushing the settings to extremes that result in an artificial look. **Less is often more** in achieving a visually pleasing and impactful HDR image.

**Types of High-Range Scenes:**

Scenes with high dynamic ranges arise for specific reasons, leading to different types of situations that may require HDR techniques:

*   **Progressive brightening** can occur in scenes like a detail of an old vaulted ceiling lit from beneath, where there is a gradual increase in brightness.
*   **Small bright against dark** is typical of spotlighting effects, whether artificial or natural, such as sunlight illuminating a small area within a darker scene.
*   A **window to a sunlit exterior** is a classic example of a high dynamic range scene with strong segmentation between the bright outside and the darker interior.
*   A **divided frame**, such as a landscape with a horizon against a bright sky, presents a significant contrast difference across a defined boundary.

Understanding these different types of high-range scenes can influence how you approach both the shooting and the tone mapping process.

**Applications of HDR:**

HDR techniques are employed across various photographic genres to enhance the final image:

*   **Landscapes:** To capture the often vast difference in brightness between the sky and the foreground, revealing detail in both.
*   **Cityscapes and Architecture:** To balance the extreme lighting differences in urban environments and bring out textures and details in buildings, both in bright sunlight and shadow.
*   **Interiors:** Particularly useful for capturing detail when shooting into bright windows from a darker interior.
*   **Flowers:** To control the lighting and capture the subtle, translucent details of petals.
*   While more care is needed, HDR can even be applied to **portraits** for specific artistic effects, though attention must be paid to subject movement and potential unnatural skin tones.
