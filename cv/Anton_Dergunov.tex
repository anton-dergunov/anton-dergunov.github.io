\section{Employment}

\whatwherewhen{Senior Applied Scientist}{\href{https://www.microsoft.com/}{Microsoft}}{May 2018 - Present}

\textit{Applying machine learning in Microsoft Office products.}

\begin{itemize}

\item People Search:

  \begin{itemize}

  \item Built from scratch the pipeline for collecting ``eyes-off'' training and testing data, monitoring its quality, and training ranking and classification models with offline evaluation, producing a model ready for product integration. Optimized the pipeline's performance to process large volumes of click log data. The model is used for \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6HO4ekmmjU}{people ranking in many Microsoft products} (such as Teams, Outlook, Bing, Windows). Deployed several models using this pipeline to production, demonstrating online metrics improvements (such as up to a 4\% increase in click-through rate and improvements in time to success). (\textsc{Azure Machine Learning}, \textsc{Python}, \textsc{PySpark}, \textsc{LightGBM}, \textsc{ONNX}, \textsc{Gradient Boosting})

  \item Implemented the \href{https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/blurbs/edgeppr.html}{Personalized PageRank} algorithm over organization people graphs for this people ranker, resulting in a 2.15\% increase in NDCG@1 and a 1.21\% increase in NCDG@3. Presented this work at an internal conference and tested other graph-based approaches produced by different teams.

  \item Conducted multiple online A/B experiments, analyzing metrics to test new features or resolve issues.

  \end{itemize}

\item Email and Document Recommendations for Meetings in Microsoft Outlook:

  \begin{itemize}

  \item Enhanced the relevance of recommendations in the Meeting Insights feature of Microsoft Outlook (\href{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/calendar-aware-proactive-email-recommendation/}{paper}, \href{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/the-story-of-an-office-ai-feature-how-ai-can-promote-efficient-meeting-preparation/}{press release}, (\href{https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/use-intelligent-technology-in-outlook-on-the-web-and-outlook-com-24b30683-8340-4b69-b8ac-4193ec528a70}{documentation}) using ML techniques and various heuristics. This feature recommends emails and documents relevant to meetings. (\textsc{Python}, \textsc{SciKit-Learn}, \textsc{NumPy}, \textsc{Pandas}, \textsc{PyTorch}, \textsc{LightGBM}, \textsc{Gradient Boosting}, \textsc{C\#})

  \item Enhanced the data extraction pipeline, increasing the amount of training data by \mytexttilde 50x, which improved model performance (AUC up by 3\%, AUPRC up by 12\%). Further data analysis improved model performance (AUC up by 3\%, AUPRC up by 4\%, NDCG@3 up by 11\%) and enabled twice as many features.

  \item Developed and validated new features for this machine learning model by identifying and optimizing new signals (e.g., social, content similarity, key phrases).

  \item Conducted extensive experiments using the \textsc{BERT} model and related neural network architectures to improve content similarity features in Meeting Insights: verified the model on multiple datasets, performed error analysis and comparison with existing features, and distilled BERT into simpler models. Integrating the model showed a 3\% increase in NDCG@3. (\textsc{BERT}, \textsc{Deep Learning}, \textsc{PyTorch})

  \item Explored various data sets, such as user interaction logs, manually annotated data, heuristically labelled ``eyes-off'' data using weak supervision and their combinations for model training (\href{https://snorkel.ai/}{Snorkel}). Conducted A/B testing to validate improvements.

  \item Prototyped a complete pipeline for data extraction, feature extraction, training, and validation of a document-to-document recommendation system. Assisted a colleague in implementing an email-to-email recommendation prototype.

  \item Developed a tool for explaining ML models predictions, aiding in error analysis and accelerating root cause detection. Contributed to other internal debugging tools. Provided supervision and mentorship for 3 interns and support for several colleagues, serving as a go-to person for the products we were implementing.
