Welcome to my blog! I'm Anton Dergunov, an avid enthusiast of machine learning and AI, with a strong background in data science and software engineering based in London, United Kingdom. I've dedicated this space to share my insights, experiments, and discoveries in these exciting fields.

### My Journey in Machine Learning

I've been fascinated by ML long before it became a trending topic. My interest in the field stems from several key motivations:

1. **Data Insight**: I love uncovering insights from data, making it a powerful tool for learning and discovery. The ability to visualize and explain data patterns is especially captivating to me, and I often use Jupyter Notebooks for their quick iteration capabilities.

2. **Understanding the Brain**: My curiosity about how the brain works also drives my interest in ML.

3. **Problem-Solving with AI**: As a true geek, I find immense satisfaction in using AI tools to solve practical problems (such as helping to organize the information that I have or be a better writer).

### Professional Background

My professional journey has been quite diverse and enriching. I earned my PhD with a focus on using knowledge representation techniques to encode expertise for fine-tuning software applications. This research led to practical implementations in tools like the [Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector](http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-trace-analyzer) and its [Performance Assistant](https://web.archive.org/web/20151022144828/https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/561522) capability.

I've had the privilege of working with renowned organizations such as Intel, Yandex, and Microsoft. At Intel, I focused on software development and research for high-performance and parallel optimization. At Yandex, I delved into ML projects like improving video ranking in their search engine. Currently, as a Senior Applied Scientist at Microsoft, I drive the integration of new ML ideas, from implementation and offline experimentation to online testing and model training in various products.

My expertise lies primarily in information retrieval and natural language processing. I have hands-on experience with various ML models, including linear models, decision trees, ensemble learning, and neural networks (including the transformer architecture). A particular area of interest for me is the interpretability of ML models, and I've developed internal tools at Microsoft for that.

Research is a deep passion of mine. During my time at university, I attended numerous summer schools covering diverse topics such as [information retrieval](http://romip.ru/russir2013/), [semantic web](https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/web/ICCL_Summer_School_2013/en), [algorithms for massive data](http://almada2013.ru/en), formal software verification(in [Moscow](https://web.archive.org/web/20110314093924/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/events/sssev2011/) and [Marseille](http://movep.lif.univ-mrs.fr/)), [parallelism and concurrency](https://web.archive.org/web/20120505213227/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/rss2012/), [programming languages](http://laser.inf.ethz.ch/2012/), etc. AOne of my notable contributions is [an article on generalized algebraic data types](http://themonadreader.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/issue221.pdf) which was reviewed by the creator of language, Simon Peyton Jones.

As a Unix enthusiast with experience in systems like FreeBSD, Solaris, and Linux, I greatly appreciate the command-line tools they offer. But for my daily activities, I choose to use macOS.

My approach to productivity and organization relies on Emacs Org mode for implementing the Getting Things Done (GTD) approach, which helps me manage projects, track tasks, and maintain a structured workflow. This tool has become an integral part of my life, enabling me to efficiently plan and execute my goals. Additionally, I maintain a comprehensive collection of personal notes in Markdown, which I’m transitioning to Obsidian to create a more organized "second brain" for accessing and managing my ideas and knowledge.

### Personal Interests

Outside of my professional pursuits, I’m deeply committed to personal growth and continuous learning.  I try to make the most of every free moment, including my daily commute, to read and stay informed. Whether it’s diving into books, articles, or research papers, I strive to turn even brief periods into opportunities for learning and enrichment.

I have a passion for languages. While I am fluent in English and Spanish, I have studied French, Italian, and German in the past but haven’t practiced them recently. I plan to revisit these languages to refresh and improve my skills.

Whenever I get the chance, I love traveling and immersing myself in nature. Some of my most cherished experiences include exploring Kyoto in Japan, taking a scenic train journey in Sri Lanka, visiting the Kon-Tiki Museum in Oslo, and marveling at the Alishan National Scenic Area in Taiwan. The highlight of my hiking adventures was the solo [Tour du Mont Blanc](https://www.autourdumontblanc.com/en/), though the most meaningful hikes were those with my parents during my childhood. My understanding of photography and videography is more technical than artistic at the moment, but I’m casually developing my creative skills as a hobby.

When it comes to relaxation, I enjoy savoring good coffee and exploring different teas. From rich, aromatic coffees to authentic Chinese, Taiwanese, and Japanese teas, I enjoy discovering and appreciating their unique flavors. To stay healthy, I dedicating some reasonable time to gym workouts, cycling, and yoga.

### Personal Interests

Beyond the professional realm, I enjoy learning new stuff and I am a tech enthusiast. 



I organize my life using Emacs Org mode and the Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology, which has become a second brain for me. My digital life is meticulously planned and executed using these tools.




I am user of Emacs org mode and basically I organize all of my life using Getting Things Done approach. Basically I have a GDT plan for all important projects in my life.

I also maintain a good collection of personal notes in Markdown as a "second brain" which I am in process of converting to Obsidian.

In my leisure time, I enjoy:

I am trying to squeeze every little opportunity when I have time to read something or do something productive (such as updating my org mode GTD plan).

- I always carry a device loaded with reading material, from books and articles to research papers. My 13-inch e-ink reader is a favorite for its ease on the eyes.
- I love tinkering with technology, my home NAS server and Raspberry Pi


various Unix flavors like FreeBSD, Solaris, and Linux. My productivity infrastructure relies heavily on command-line and Unix tools.
- Traveling is a passion, with memorable trips to Japan, Sri Lanka, and hiking adventures like the solo Tour de Mont Blanc.
- While I have a strong technical understanding, I'm gradually improving my artistic skills in photography and videography.
- I prioritize staying healthy through activities like gym workouts, cycling, and yoga.
- Besides English, I speak Spanish and have dabbled in French, Italian, and German. I also enjoy good coffee and authentic tea from China, Taiwan, and Japan.

I'm an data scientist, ML specialist and enthusiast, geek and Unix lover, hiker, photographer... TBD continue. My vision for life is to be the best version of myself, and to realize any talents and potential that I have. I currently live in London, United Kingdom, for quite a long time, and possess British citizenship.

The goal of this blog is to share on ML, anything that I have found interesting while playing with ML topics...

I am deeply passionate about machine learning, and you can see me spending my free time experimenting with various ML techniques (some of them are shared on [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/anton-dergunov/ml-playground)). The field of ML is experiencing a true boom at the moment and it is kind of in fasion, especially with the rise of generative AI, but I got my interest in the field much earlier. The reasons why I am so interested in ML: 1) I am really like being able to extract insights from the data. I see it as a great practical capability. As much as I like learning, this is a great tool to learn something. I am especially facinated by the explanation capabilities and visualization techniques. I enjoy using Jupyter Notebooks, because they allow me to experiment with data and iterate quickly. 2) I am also interested in ML, since I am intested in how the brain works. 3) I am also passionate to create software to solve interesting problems in an interesting way. Being a true geek myself, I like when I can achieve the task much quicker using AI tools.

I have chosen to work on ML topics in the university, and I was giving lectures in AI while doing my PhD. I was not always able to work on ML at work (since my home town is not a very large city). For example, I worked at Intel doing software development and research for high performance and parallel optimization. But I was happy to work at Yandex on purely ML projects (ranking of videos in Yandex search engine). I am currently working at Microsoft as a senior applied scientist (essentially a data scientist).

Most of my experience is in the area of information retrieval and natural language processing. I find Jupyter Notebooks to be a truly exciting platform to use because it allows fast pace of experimentation. Working as a data scientist at Microsoft and Yandex, I had experience to drive the integration of new ideas (such as new features for ML model) from their initial implementation, offline experimentation, testing these ideas online and demonstrating if they are effective; as well as building complete ML pipelines for training the models. I had experience using various types of ML models such as linear models, decision trees, ensamble learning, different architectures of neural networks, etc. Another special interest is interpretability of ML models (I have built some internal tools at Microsoft for that). Besides that, I also had experience with knowledge representation and other classical ML topics.

I have deep passion about research. It's a true pleasure when I can write something in LaTeX. TBD Put more stuff...

The topic of my PhD was attempting to use knowledge representation techniques to encode expertise of performance engineers for fine-tuning software applications. I have implemented this approach in [Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector](http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-trace-analyzer) and its [Performance Assistant](https://web.archive.org/web/20151022144828/https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/561522) capability. Later I was working on a research project: representing knowledge about performance issues in applications and their automatic detection for [Intel VTune Amplifier](http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-vtune-amplifier-xe) and [Intel Advisor](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-advisor-xe) products. That was a project at the intersection of AI (knowledge representation) and HPC.

While I was at university, I was going to many different summer schools, and the topics were as diverse as [information retrieval](http://romip.ru/russir2013/), [semantic web](https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/web/ICCL_Summer_School_2013/en), [algorithms for massive data](http://almada2013.ru/en), formal software verification(in [Moscow](https://web.archive.org/web/20110314093924/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/events/sssev2011/) and [Marseille](http://movep.lif.univ-mrs.fr/)), [parallelism and concurrency](https://web.archive.org/web/20120505213227/http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/rss2012/), [programming languages](http://laser.inf.ethz.ch/2012/), etc. At some point I got interested in functional programming languages and Haskell, and authored [a paper in generalized algebraic data types](http://themonadreader.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/issue221.pdf) which was reviewed by the creator of language, Simon Peyton Jones.

Besides that, I am a true geek myself. While I was thinking to have this blog solely on ML, I think I might also share some of my experience with awesome technology. For example, I am user of Emacs org mode and basically I organize all of my life using Getting Things Done approach. Basically I have a GDT plan for all important projects in my life. It took me quite some time to start with this (initially I sacrificed my long Christmas holiday for the start), to create a working system and then to maintain that, but I really like it, because it allows me to use that "second brain" to store all of my tasks. Speaking about the "second brain", I also maintain a good collection of personal notes in Markdown which I am in process of converting to Obsidian.

In my free time most of all I enjoy learning new stuff. People that know me know that I always carry with me a device for reading and I am trying to squeeze every little opportunity when I have time to read something or do something productive (such as updating my org mode GTD plan). My iPad is always with me and provides me reading material: lots of books, articles, papers to read. But when I am at home, I truly enjoy my 13-inch e-ink reader which displays ML papers in PDF so nicely and is so easy on the eyes!

I like messing up with technology and geekery: such as my home NAS server and Raspberry Pi. I really like Unix and the tools that it provides. I had experience with various flavours such as FreeBSD (my first Unix), Solaris, different Linux versions. Command line tools and Unix tools is my infrastructure of choice for productivity. I use MacOS for my personal work, but I keep a laptop with Linux and KDE which I configured to have the best features and look and feel of MacOS that I like.

When time allows, of course I enjoy travelling. TBD Trip to Japan. Maybe some other places (railway in Sri Lanka, Kon Tiki museum, Kyoto, etc). I like spending time in nature when I can and hiking. The most exciting hike that I have done was doing solo [Tour de Mont Blanc](https://www.autourdumontblanc.com/en/), but the most memorable ones were with my parents in my childhood. I like photography and video, but I must admit that at the moment I have a much better understanding of it from a technological perspective (which eventually resulted in me having lots of different equipment) than from an artistic perspective, but I believe I will learn it over time. It is important for me to keep myself healthy, so there is a place for some sport in my life (such as gym, cycling and yoga which really helps with those long hours in front of the computer). I like learning foreign languages (besides my native language and English, I can speak and understand every day Spanish fairly well; I took courses in French, Italian and German, but I was not using these languages for a long time, so I would need to revise them). I also enjoy good coffee and authentic Chinese/Taiwanese/Japanese tea (of which I have probably a bit too much at home). TBD Write about piano.
