Hi! My name is Anton Dergunov.

I am excited about machine learning, data analysis and software engineering
in general. At the moment I work as a Senior Applied Scientist at Microsoft
on various machine learning projects.

Before Microsoft, I was working at [Yandex][yandex], Intel and some
other companies.

You may access [my LinkedIn account][linkedin].

I usually spend a lot of my spare time playing with machine learning and
data analysis, or learning new tech. Otherwise I enjoy all kinds of sport
(yoga, swimming, cycling, gym, skiing, etc.), travelling,
cracking escape rooms, cooking tasty food, etc.
